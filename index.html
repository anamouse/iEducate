            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and
                accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term
                socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the
                Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is
                designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and
                directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often
                little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead,
                the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all
                adults act as teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed
                on from one generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must
                evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the
                school and the specialist called the teacher. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">One explanation for the changes evidenced in this “institutionalist”
                view of education can be found in the human-capital theory first popularized by American economist
                Theodore Schultz in “Investment in Human Capital,” his presidential address to the American Economic
                Association in 1960. According to this theory, education is not a form of consumption that represents a
                costly expenditure for government but instead serves as an investment that improves the economic worth
                of individuals (e.g., human capital) and thereby raises a country’s overall productivity and economic
                competitiveness. In other words, governments support education because it ultimately strengthens their
                countries.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag small-text">The American philosopher John Dewey believed that education should mean
                the total development of the child. On the basis of the observations he made at the University of
                Chicago Laboratory Schools—the experimental elementary schools that he founded in 1896—Dewey developed
                revolutionary educational theories that sparked the progressive education movement in the United States.
                As he propounded in The School and Society (1899) and The Child and the Curriculum (1902), education
                must be tied to experience, not abstract thought, and must be built upon the interests and developmental
                needs of the child. He argued for a student-centred, not subject-centred, curriculum and stressed the
                teaching of critical thought over rote memorization. </p>
