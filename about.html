                <h3>Proven learning approaches</h3>
                <p>Teaching is one of the most challenging and complex jobs on the planet. Our digital resources, tools,
                    and learning materials are developed by educational experts to incorporate leading pedagogical
                    practices. They are useful in any type of teaching moment and many can be used to support national
                    education standards.</p>

                <h3>Empowered educators</h3>
                <p>From school teachers and tutors to home schoolers and parents, engaged adults are the key to
                    unlocking each child's potential and drive to learn. We empower all kinds of educators to teach kids
                    by providing the best educational resources in any form or device to be used at home, at school, and
                    everywhere in-between.</p>

                <p>We continue to provide academically sound content of the highest caliber and welcome input from our
                    users as we address issues of equity, diversity, inclusivity and representation. Since we know there
                    are many different approaches to teaching and education, we develop our materials to complement
                    these different philosophies across subjects and grades.</p>
